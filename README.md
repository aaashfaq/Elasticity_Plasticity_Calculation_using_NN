# Elasticity_Plasticity_Calculation_using_NN

A nueral network constitutive model for 1D cyclic plasticity has been proposed by Masaki Teranishi. He proposes a neural network-based constitutive model for uniaxial cyclic
plasticity, integrating a feed-forward neural network with a return mapping algorithm.

In this project, we have implemented a neural network that can be used to obtain the values of plastic strain when cyclic strain or sine strain is applied to a material. The ground truth dataset was obtained by implementing the von mises plasticity model.

For testing the accuracy of the developed model we have also generated hysterisis loops using the stress strain values calculated from the von mises plasticity model and those obtained from the neural network.
