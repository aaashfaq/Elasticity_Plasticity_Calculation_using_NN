# Elasticity_Plasticity_Calculation_using_NN

A nueral network constitutive model for 1D cyclic plasticity has been proposed by Teranishi
[2022]. He proposes a neural network-based constitutive model for uniaxial cyclic
plasticity, integrating a feed-forward neural network with a return mapping algorithm.
The model demonstrates improved computational eciency, reducing calculation time by
70%, and maintains accuracy under random loading conditions, making it suitable for
large-scale structural simulations^a.
